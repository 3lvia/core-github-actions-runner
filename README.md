# core-github-actions-runner

Configuration for generating the OS images used by Elvias GitHub Actions runners.

The image is generated in the GitHub workflow [generate-image.yml](.github/workflows/generate-image.yml) using Packer.
Packer will also push the image to Azure.

The Terraform code for the VM scale sets running the image is in the [core-terraform](https://github.com/3lvia/core-terraform) repository.
The credentials for authenticating to Azure are stored in the GitHub repository variables/secrets and are also configured in the core-terraform repository.
